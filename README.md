# KickStart My Chart
## Background
* Over two billion dollars have been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the over 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.
* Since getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick to finding success. For this week's homework, you will organize and analyze a database of four thousand past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.
## Instructions
* Using the Excel table provided, you will be modifying and analyzing the data of four thousand past Kickstarter projects as you attempt to uncover some of the market trends.
* Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the state column with a different color, depending on whether the associated campaign was "successful," "failed," "cancelled," or is currently "live".
* Create a new column at column O called percent funded that uses a formula to uncover how much money a campaign made towards reaching its initial goal.
  * Use conditional formatting to fill each cell in the percent funded column using a three-color scale. The scale should start at 0 and be a dark shade of red, transitioning to green at 100, and then moving towards blue at 200.
* Create a new column at column P called average donation that uses a formula to uncover how much each backer for the project paid on average.
* Create two new columns, one called category at Q and another called sub-category at R, which use formulas to split the Category and Sub-Category column into two parts.
